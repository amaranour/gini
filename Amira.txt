On thursday, We will go to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. 
Nour Eddine doesnt want to go with us because he said the weather is not the perfect one to go swimming. 
Amira is so exciting that she will go to another house that faces the beach. She will be able to look at the beach from the 
balcony. Amira will meet with her favorite friends whose names are  Manar, Dania, and Nasma. Amira will celebrate her 7th 
birthday with her sister and her mum and dad and friends. Amira is the most beautiful girl on earth.
